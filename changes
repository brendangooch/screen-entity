v2.0.0
    updated to dynamic-objects v5.0.0, which has substantial changes in functionality
    removed public override widthTo()/heightTo() as these methods no longer exist on parent
    made updateHitRadius public as client/child will need to call each time width/height updated
    updated isHit/isHitPrecise() methods to work with new DynamicRectangle methods
    isHit/isHitPrecise() methods now return a number --> distance to center of entity or -1 on miss
